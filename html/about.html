<h3>Overview</h3>

This web application was created to facilitate the dissemination and exploration of
various "feature weights", with a "feature" typically being either a gene or a pathway /
gene set.

The feature weights shown were generated by measuring gene- and pathway-level
associations for multiple datasets, using several different methods including logistic
regression, cox survival regression, and pearson/spearman correlation.

Weights were then computed by applying some function (e.g. mean or max) to the resulting
p-values or correlation scores, across all samples tested.

In addition to weights generated for each of the individual sources, there is also a
"combined" dataset which combines information across all of the sources used.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

The data sources used to generate the current version of the feature weights include:
